Overall:
Glad to see you’re getting github working. Your CSS and HTML is coming together nicely.

What looks good:

You were able to replicate the Nav across both pages.
You got the boxes separated out on the services page nicely.

Suggestions:
Read the project instructions carefully before beginning to code; and refer back if you have any questions during the project. There were a few pieces that you missed:
1.	You want to link the main page to the ‘services’ page with an <a> tag
2.	You want to link the services page to the ‘main’ page as well.
